# MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS 
### FROM SCRATCH

This repo contains my own implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, all in Python. 

**Note:** the code is not optimized for running at scale unless noted. It's merely a way for me to solidify my understanding of the algorithmic mechanics. Hopefully you'll find it useful as well.
